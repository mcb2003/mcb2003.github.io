From joining the school gernalism club many years ago, to starting &lt;a href="https://blindcomputing.org">Blind Computing&lt;/a>,
which was initially completely article based, to the various blogs I created on &lt;a href="https://blogger.google.com">Google&amp;rsquo;s Blogger platform&lt;/a>
in the years before that, it&amp;rsquo;s always been a passion of mine to research and gather information from all across
the internet, and from life in general, and consolidate it into something that could be of use to someone else.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
